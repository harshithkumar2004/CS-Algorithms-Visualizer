# CS-Algorithms-Visualizer
  
This project focuses on visualization and analysis tool for various algorithms, including sorting, data structures, and machine learning models. As a developer, I wanted to create an intuitive way to understand and analyze how different algorithms work step by step.  

## What This Project Includes  
- Sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.  
- Data structures and their operations in action.  
- Machine Learning algorithms visualization and analysis.  
- Real-time, interactive, and high-quality plots for better understanding.  

## How to Use  
1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project folder:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CS-Algorithms-Visualizer.git
   cd CS-Algorithms-Visualizer
   ```

2. Run the application:  
   ```bash
   streamlit run algo.py
   ```

## Future Scope  
ðŸ”¹ Adding more sorting, searching, and graph algorithms.  
ðŸ”¹ Implementing advanced data structures like Trie, AVL, and Red-Black Trees.  
ðŸ”¹ Expanding into Machine Learning model visualizations.  
ðŸ”¹ Enhancing UI with animations and better analytics.  

## This project is a work in progress, and I plan to improve it continuously. Contributions, suggestions, and ideas are always welcome! ðŸš€
